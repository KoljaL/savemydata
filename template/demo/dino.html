<p><strong>Dinosaurs</strong> are a diverse group of <a href="/wiki/Reptile">reptiles</a><sup><a href="#cite_note-cold-blooded-7">[note 1]</a></sup> of the <a href="/wiki/Clade">clade</a><strong>Dinosauria</strong>. They first appeared during the <a href="/wiki/Triassic">Triassic</a>
    <a href="/wiki/Geological_period">period</a>, between 243 and 233.23&nbsp;<a href="/wiki/Annum">million years ago</a>, although the exact origin and timing of the <a href="/wiki/Evolution_of_dinosaurs">evolution of dinosaurs</a> is the subject of
    active research. They became the dominant terrestrial <a href="/wiki/Vertebrate">vertebrates</a> after the <a href="/wiki/Triassic%E2%80%93Jurassic_extinction_event">Triassic&ndash;Jurassic extinction event</a> 201.3&nbsp;million years ago; their
    dominance continued throughout the
    <a href="/wiki/Jurassic">Jurassic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> periods. The <a href="/wiki/Fossil">fossil</a> record shows that <a href="/wiki/Bird">birds</a> are modern <a href="/wiki/Feathered_dinosaur">feathered dinosaurs</a>,
    having <a href="/wiki/Evolution_of_birds">evolved</a> from earlier <a href="/wiki/Theropoda">theropods</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Late_Jurassic">Late Jurassic</a>
    <a href="/wiki/Epoch_(geology)">epoch</a>, and are the only dinosaur lineage to survive the <a href="/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event">Cretaceous&ndash;Paleogene extinction event</a> approximately 66&nbsp;million years ago. Dinosaurs
    can therefore be divided into <strong>avian dinosaurs</strong>, or birds; and the extinct <strong>non-avian dinosaurs</strong>, which are all dinosaurs other than birds.</p>
<p>Dinosaurs are a varied group of animals from <a href="/wiki/Taxonomy_(biology)">taxonomic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Morphology_(biology)">morphological</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ecology">ecological</a> standpoints. Birds, at over 10,700 living <a href="/wiki/Species">species</a>,
    are among the most diverse group of vertebrates. Using fossil evidence, <a href="/wiki/Paleontology">paleontologists</a> have identified over 900 distinct <a href="/wiki/Genus">genera</a> and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs.
    Dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both <a href="/wiki/Neontology#Extant_taxa_vs._extinct_taxa">extant</a> species (birds) and fossil remains. Through the first half of the 20th century, before birds were recognized as dinosaurs, most
    of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and <a href="/wiki/Poikilotherm">cold-blooded</a>. Most <a href="/wiki/Dinosaur_renaissance">research conducted since the 1970s</a>, however, has indicated that dinosaurs were active
    animals with elevated <a href="/wiki/Metabolism">metabolisms</a> and numerous adaptations for social interaction. Some were <a href="/wiki/Herbivore">herbivorous</a>, others <a href="/wiki/Carnivore">carnivorous</a>. Evidence suggests that all dinosaurs
    were <a href="/wiki/Oviparity">egg-laying</a>; and that <a href="/wiki/Nest">nest</a>-building was a trait shared by many dinosaurs, both avian and non-avian.</p>
<p>While dinosaurs were ancestrally <a href="/wiki/Bipedalism">bipedal</a>, many <a href="/wiki/Extinction">extinct</a> groups included <a href="/wiki/Quadrupedalism">quadrupedal</a> species, and some were able to shift between these stances. Elaborate display
    structures such as horns or crests are common to all dinosaur groups, and some extinct groups developed <a href="/wiki/Skeleton">skeletal</a> modifications such as <a href="/wiki/Armour_(anatomy)">bony armor</a> and
    <a href="/wiki/Spine_(zoology)">spines</a>. While the dinosaurs' modern-day surviving avian lineage (birds) are generally small due to the constraints of flight, many prehistoric dinosaurs (non-avian and avian) were large-bodied&mdash;the largest
    <a href="/wiki/Sauropoda">sauropod</a> dinosaurs are estimated to have reached lengths of 39.7 meters (130 feet) and heights of 18&nbsp;m (59&nbsp;ft) and were the largest land animals of all time. The misconception that non-avian dinosaurs were uniformly
    gigantic is based in part on <a href="/wiki/Taphonomy">preservation bias</a>, as large, sturdy <a href="/wiki/Bone">bones</a> are more likely to last until they are fossilized. Many dinosaurs were quite small, some measuring about 50 centimeters (20
    inches) in length.</p>
<p>The first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early 19th century, with the name "dinosaur" (meaning "terrible lizard") having been coined by Sir <a href="/wiki/Richard_Owen">Richard Owen</a> in 1841 to refer to these "great fossil lizards". Since
    then, mounted fossil dinosaur skeletons have been major attractions at museums worldwide, and dinosaurs have become an enduring part of popular culture. The large sizes of some dinosaurs, as well as their seemingly monstrous and fantastic nature,
    have ensured their regular appearance in best-selling books and films, such as <em><a href="/wiki/Jurassic_Park">Jurassic Park</a></em>. Persistent public enthusiasm for the animals has resulted in significant funding for dinosaur science, and new
    discoveries are regularly covered by the media.</p>

<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>Under <a href="/wiki/Phylogenetic_nomenclature">phylogenetic nomenclature</a>, dinosaurs are usually defined as the group consisting of the <a href="/wiki/Most_recent_common_ancestor">most recent common ancestor</a> (MRCA) of <em><a href="/wiki/Triceratops">Triceratops</a></em>    and <a href="/wiki/Bird#Diversification_of_modern_birds">modern birds</a> (Neornithes), and all its descendants.<sup><a href="#cite_note-MJB04dino-8">[7]</a></sup> It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined with respect to the MRCA of <em><a href="/wiki/Megalosaurus">Megalosaurus</a></em>    and <em><a href="/wiki/Iguanodon">Iguanodon</a></em>, because these were two of the three genera cited by <a href="/wiki/Richard_Owen">Richard Owen</a> when he recognized the Dinosauria.
    <sup><a href="#cite_note-olshevsky2000-9">[8]</a></sup> Both definitions result in the same set of animals being defined as dinosaurs: "Dinosauria = <a href="/wiki/Ornithischia">Ornithischia</a> + <a href="/wiki/Saurischia">Saurischia</a>". This definition
    includes major groups such as <a href="/wiki/Ankylosauria">ankylosaurians</a> (armored herbivorous quadrupeds), <a href="/wiki/Stegosauria">stegosaurians</a> (plated herbivorous quadrupeds), <a href="/wiki/Ceratopsia">ceratopsians</a> (bipedal or
    quadrupedal herbivores with <a href="/wiki/Neck_frill">neck frills</a>), <a href="/wiki/Pachycephalosauria">pachycephalosaurians</a> (bipedal herbivores with thick skulls), <a href="/wiki/Ornithopoda">ornithopods</a> (bipedal or quadrupedal herbivores
    including "<a href="/wiki/Hadrosauridae">duck-bills</a>"), <a href="/wiki/Theropoda">theropods</a> (mostly bipedal carnivores and birds), and <a href="/wiki/Sauropodomorpha">sauropodomorphs</a> (mostly large herbivorous quadrupeds with long necks
    and tails).<sup><a href="#cite_note-Letal05-10">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Birds are now recognized as being the sole surviving lineage of theropod dinosaurs. In traditional <a href="/wiki/Taxonomy_(biology)">taxonomy</a>, birds were considered a separate <a href="/wiki/Class_(biology)">class</a> that had evolved from dinosaurs,
    a distinct <a href="/wiki/Superorder">superorder</a>. However, a majority of contemporary paleontologists concerned with dinosaurs reject the traditional style of classification in favor of <a href="/wiki/Phylogenetics">phylogenetic</a> taxonomy;
    this approach requires that, for a group to be natural, all descendants of members of the group must be included in the group as well. Birds are thus considered to be dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct.<sup><a href="#cite_note-11">[10]</a></sup>    Birds are classified as belonging to the subgroup <a href="/wiki/Maniraptora">Maniraptora</a>, which are <a href="/wiki/Coelurosauria">coelurosaurs</a>, which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.<sup><a href="#cite_note-KP04-12">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Research by Matthew G. Baron, <a href="/wiki/David_B._Norman">David B. Norman</a>, and Paul M. Barrett in 2017 suggested a radical revision of dinosaurian systematics. Phylogenetic analysis by Baron <em>et al.</em> recovered the Ornithischia as being
    closer to the Theropoda than the Sauropodomorpha, as opposed to the traditional union of theropods with sauropodomorphs. They resurrected the clade <a href="/wiki/Ornithoscelida">Ornithoscelida</a> to refer to the group containing Ornithischia and
    Theropoda. Dinosauria itself was re-defined as the last common ancestor of <em>Triceratops horridus</em>, <em><a href="/wiki/House_sparrow">Passer domesticus</a></em> and <em><a href="/wiki/Diplodocus">Diplodocus carnegii</a></em>, and all of its
    descendants, to ensure that sauropods and kin remain included as dinosaurs.<sup><a href="#cite_note-NYT-20170322-13">[12]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-NAT-20170322-14">[13]</a></sup></p>

<p>Using one of the above definitions, dinosaurs can be generally described as <a href="/wiki/Archosaur">archosaurs</a> with <a href="/wiki/Terrestrial_locomotion#Posture">hind limbs held erect beneath the body</a>. <sup><a href="#cite_note-DFG97-15">[14]</a></sup>    Other prehistoric animals, including <a href="/wiki/Pterosaur">pterosaurs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mosasaur">mosasaurs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ichthyosaur">ichthyosaurs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Plesiosauria">plesiosaurs</a>, and <em><a href="/wiki/Dimetrodon">Dimetrodon</a></em>,
    while often popularly conceived of as dinosaurs, are not taxonomically classified as dinosaurs.<sup><a href="#cite_note-Forbes-16">[15]</a></sup> Pterosaurs are distantly related to dinosaurs, being members of the clade <a href="/wiki/Avemetatarsalia">Ornithodira</a>.
    The other groups mentioned are, like dinosaurs and pterosaurs, members of <a href="/wiki/Sauropsida">Sauropsida</a> (the reptile and bird clade), except <em>Dimetrodon</em> (which is a <a href="/wiki/Synapsid">synapsid</a>). None of them had the erect
    hind limb posture characteristic of true dinosaurs.<sup><a href="#cite_note-DL90-17">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Dinosaurs were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the <a href="/wiki/Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a><a href="/wiki/Era">Era</a>, especially the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Other groups of animals were restricted in size and niches; <a href="/wiki/Mammal">mammals</a>,
    for example, rarely exceeded the size of a domestic cat, and were generally rodent-sized carnivores of small prey.<sup><a href="#cite_note-MM97-18">[17]</a></sup> They have always been recognized as an extremely varied group of animals; over 900 non-avian
    dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty as of 2018, and the total number of genera preserved in the fossil record has been estimated at around 1850, nearly 75% of which remain to be discovered, and 1124 species by 2016.<sup><a href="#cite_note-Genera900-19">[18]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-Howmany-20">[19]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-Wang&amp;Dodson-21">[20]</a></sup>    A 1995 study predicted that about 3,400 dinosaur genera ever existed, including many that would not have been preserved in the fossil record.<sup><a href="#cite_note-russell1995-22">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2016, the estimated number of dinosaur species that existed in the Mesozoic was 1,543&ndash;2,468.<sup><a href="#cite_note-23">[22]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-24">[23]</a></sup> In 2021, the number of modern-day birds (avian dinosaurs) was estimated
    to be at 10,806 species.<sup><a href="#cite_note-25">[24]</a></sup> Some are herbivorous, others carnivorous, including seed-eaters, fish-eaters, insectivores, and omnivores. While dinosaurs were ancestrally bipedal (as are all modern birds), some
    prehistoric species were quadrupeds, and others, such as <em><a href="/wiki/Anchisaurus">Anchisaurus</a></em> and <em>Iguanodon</em>, could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Cranial modifications like horns and crests are common dinosaurian
    traits, and some extinct species had bony armor. Although known for large size, many Mesozoic dinosaurs were human-sized or smaller, and modern birds are generally small in size. Dinosaurs today inhabit every continent, and fossils show that they
    had achieved global distribution by at least the <a href="/wiki/Early_Jurassic">Early Jurassic</a> epoch.<sup><a href="#cite_note-MacLeod-26">[25]</a></sup> Modern birds inhabit most available habitats, from terrestrial to marine, and there is evidence
    that some non-avian dinosaurs (such as <em><a href="/wiki/Microraptor">Microraptor</a></em>) could fly or at least glide, and others, such as <a href="/wiki/Spinosauridae">spinosaurids</a>, had <a href="/wiki/List_of_semiaquatic_tetrapods">semiaquatic</a>    habits.<sup><a href="#cite_note-theropods-27">[26]</a></sup></p>
<h3>Distinguishing anatomical features</h3>
<p>While recent discoveries have made it more difficult to present a universally agreed-upon list of their distinguishing features, nearly all dinosaurs discovered so far share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton, or are clearly
    descendants of older dinosaurs showing these modifications. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical for Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on
    to their descendants. Such modifications, originating in the most recent common ancestor of a certain taxonomic group, are called the <a href="/wiki/Synapomorphy_and_apomorphy">synapomorphies</a> of such a group.<sup><a href="#cite_note-B012-28">[27]</a></sup></p>

<p>A detailed assessment of archosaur interrelations by <a href="/wiki/Sterling_Nesbitt">Sterling Nesbitt</a><sup><a href="#cite_note-nesbitt2011-29">[28]</a></sup> confirmed or found the following twelve unambiguous synapomorphies, some previously known:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>In the <a href="/wiki/Skull">skull</a>, a supratemporal fossa (excavation) is present in front of the <a href="/wiki/Skull#Structure">supratemporal fenestra</a>, the main opening in the rear skull roof</li>
    <li><a href="/wiki/Epipophyses">Epipophyses</a>, obliquely backward-pointing processes on the rear top corners of the anterior (front) neck <a href="/wiki/Vertebra">vertebrae</a> behind the <a href="/wiki/Atlas_(anatomy)">atlas</a> and
        <a href="/wiki/Axis_(anatomy)">axis</a>, the first two neck vertebrae</li>
    <li>Apex of a deltopectoral crest (a projection on which the <a href="/wiki/Clavipectoral_triangle">deltopectoral</a> muscles attach) located at or more than 30% down the length of the <a href="/wiki/Humerus">humerus</a> (upper arm bone)</li>
    <li><a href="/wiki/Radius_(bone)">Radius</a>, a lower arm bone, shorter than 80% of humerus length</li>
    <li><a href="/wiki/Fourth_trochanter">Fourth trochanter</a> (projection where the <a href="/wiki/Caudofemoralis">caudofemoralis</a> muscle attaches on the inner rear shaft) on the <a href="/wiki/Femur">femur</a> (thigh bone) is a sharp flange</li>
    <li>Fourth trochanter asymmetrical, with distal, lower, margin forming a steeper angle to the shaft</li>
    <li>On the <a href="/wiki/Talus_bone">astragalus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Calcaneus">calcaneum</a>, upper ankle bones, the proximal articular facet, the top connecting surface, for the <a href="/wiki/Fibula">fibula</a> occupies less than 30% of the transverse
        width of the element</li>
    <li>Exoccipitals (bones at the back of the skull) do not meet along the midline on the floor of the endocranial cavity, the inner space of the braincase</li>
    <li>In the pelvis, the proximal articular surfaces of the <a href="/wiki/Ischium">ischium</a> with the <a href="/wiki/Ilium_(bone)">ilium</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Pubis_(bone)">pubis</a> are separated by a large concave surface (on the upper side of
        the ischium a part of the open hip joint is located between the contacts with the pubic bone and the ilium)</li>
    <li><a href="/wiki/Cnemial_crest">Cnemial crest</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Tibia">tibia</a> (protruding part of the top surface of the shinbone) arcs anterolaterally (curves to the front and the outer side)</li>
    <li>Distinct proximodistally oriented (vertical) ridge present on the posterior face of the distal end of the tibia (the rear surface of the lower end of the shinbone)</li>
    <li>Concave articular surface for the fibula of the calcaneum (the top surface of the calcaneum, where it touches the fibula) has a hollow profile</li>
</ul>
<p>Nesbitt found a number of further potential synapomorphies and discounted a number of synapomorphies previously suggested. Some of these are also present in <a href="/wiki/Silesauridae">silesaurids</a>, which Nesbitt recovered as a sister group to Dinosauria,
    including a large anterior trochanter, metatarsals II and IV of subequal length, reduced contact between ischium and pubis, the presence of a cnemial crest on the tibia and of an ascending process on the astragalus, and many others.<sup><a href="#cite_note-MJB04dino-8">[7]</a></sup></p>

    </div>
</div>
<p>A variety of other skeletal features are shared by dinosaurs. However, because they are either common to other groups of archosaurs or were not present in all early dinosaurs, these features are not considered to be synapomorphies. For example, as
    <a href="/wiki/Diapsid">diapsids</a>, dinosaurs ancestrally had two pairs of <a href="/wiki/Infratemporal_fenestra">Infratemporal fenestrae</a> (openings in the skull behind the eyes), and as members of the diapsid group Archosauria, had additional
    openings in the <a href="/wiki/Antorbital_fenestra">snout</a> and lower jaw.<sup><a href="#cite_note-TRHJ00-30">[29]</a></sup> Additionally, several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs,
    or were absent in the earliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaur groups. These include an elongated <a href="/wiki/Scapula">scapula</a>, or shoulder blade; a <a href="/wiki/Sacrum">sacrum</a> composed of three or more fused
    vertebrae (three are found in some other archosaurs, but only two are found in <em><a href="/wiki/Herrerasaurus">Herrerasaurus</a></em>);<sup><a href="#cite_note-MJB04dino-8">[7]</a></sup> and a perforate
    <a href="/wiki/Acetabulum">acetabulum</a>, or hip socket, with a hole at the center of its inside surface (closed in <em><a href="/wiki/Saturnalia_tupiniquim">Saturnalia tupiniquim</a></em>, for example).<sup><a href="#cite_note-UC_Berkeley_Journal_of_Earth_Sciences-31">[30]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-LARB99-32">[31]</a></sup>    Another difficulty of determining distinctly dinosaurian features is that early dinosaurs and other archosaurs from the <a href="/wiki/Late_Triassic">Late Triassic</a> epoch are often poorly known and were similar in many ways; these animals have
    sometimes been misidentified in the literature.<sup><a href="#cite_note-NIP07-33">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>Dinosaurs stand with their hind limbs erect in a manner similar to <a href="/wiki/Evolution_of_mammals#Erect_limbs">most modern mammals</a>, but distinct from most other reptiles, whose limbs sprawl out to either side.<sup><a href="#cite_note-Holland1909-34">[33]</a></sup>    This posture is due to the development of a laterally facing recess in the pelvis (usually an open socket) and a corresponding inwardly facing distinct head on the femur.<sup><a href="#cite_note-MJB00-35">[34]</a></sup> Their erect posture enabled
    early dinosaurs to breathe easily while moving, which likely permitted stamina and activity levels that <a href="/wiki/Carrier%27s_constraint">surpassed those of "sprawling" reptiles</a>.<sup><a href="#cite_note-RC05-36">[35]</a></sup> Erect limbs
    probably also helped support the <a href="/wiki/Evolution">evolution</a> of large size by reducing bending stresses on limbs.<sup><a href="#cite_note-TKMB07-37">[36]</a></sup> Some non-dinosaurian archosaurs, including <a href="/wiki/Rauisuchia">rauisuchians</a>,
    also had erect limbs but achieved this by a "pillar-erect" configuration of the hip joint, where instead of having a projection from the femur insert on a socket on the hip, the <a href="/wiki/Ilium_(bone)">upper pelvic bone</a> was rotated to form
    an overhanging shelf.<sup><a href="#cite_note-TKMB07-37">[36]</a></sup></p>

<p>Scholarly descriptions of what would now be recognized as dinosaur bones first appeared in the late 17th century in England. Part of a bone, now known to have been the femur of a <em>Megalosaurus</em>,<sup><a href="#cite_note-WAS97-41">[40]</a></sup>    was recovered from a limestone quarry at <a href="/wiki/Cornwell,_Oxfordshire">Cornwell</a> near <a href="/wiki/Chipping_Norton">Chipping Norton</a>, Oxfordshire, in 1676.

    of Chemistry at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oxford">University of Oxford</a> and first curator of the <a href="/wiki/Ashmolean_Museum">Ashmolean Museum</a>, who published a description in his <em>The Natural History of Oxford-shire</em> (1677).<sup><a href="#cite_note-42">[41]</a></sup>    He correctly identified the bone as the lower extremity of the femur of a large animal, and recognized that it was too large to belong to any known species. He, therefore, concluded it to be the femur of a huge human, perhaps a <a href="/wiki/Titan_(mythology)">Titan</a>    or another type of giant featured in legends.<sup><a href="#cite_note-43">[42]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-44">[43]</a></sup><a href="/wiki/Edward_Lhuyd">Edward Lhuyd</a>, a friend of <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Newton">Sir Isaac Newton</a>, published

<p>Between 1815 and 1824, the Rev <a href="/wiki/William_Buckland">William Buckland</a>, the first Reader of Geology at the University of Oxford, collected more fossilized bones of <em>Megalosaurus</em> and became the first person to describe a non-avian
    dinosaur in a <a href="/wiki/Scientific_journal">scientific journal</a>.<sup><a href="#cite_note-WAS97-41">[40]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-buckland1824-48">[47]</a></sup> The second non-avian dinosaur genus to be identified,
    <em>Iguanodon</em>, was discovered in 1822 by <a href="/wiki/Mary_Ann_Mantell">Mary Ann Mantell</a>&nbsp;&ndash; the wife of English geologist <a href="/wiki/Gideon_Mantell">Gideon Mantell</a>. Gideon Mantell recognized similarities between his fossils

<p>The study of these "great fossil lizards" soon became of great interest to European and American scientists, and in 1841 the English paleontologist Sir Richard Owen coined the term "dinosaur", using it to refer to the "distinct tribe or sub-order of Saurian
    Reptiles" that were then being recognized in England and around the world.<sup><a href="#cite_note-Owen1841-51">[50]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-52">[51]</a></sup> The term is derived from <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language">Ancient Greek</a>

    intended it to also evoke their size and majesty.<sup><a href="#cite_note-FBS97-54">[53]</a></sup> Owen recognized that the remains that had been found so far, <em>Iguanodon</em>, <em>Megalosaurus</em> and <em><a href="/wiki/Hylaeosaurus">Hylaeosaurus</a></em>,
    shared a number of distinctive features, and so decided to present them as a distinct taxonomic group. With the backing of <a href="/wiki/Albert,_Prince_Consort">Prince Albert</a>, the husband of <a href="/wiki/Queen_Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>,
    Owen established the <a href="/wiki/Natural_History_Museum,_London">Natural History Museum, London</a>, to display the national collection of dinosaur fossils and other biological and geological exhibits.<sup><a href="#cite_note-owen94-55">[54]</a></sup></p>
<h3>Discoveries in North America</h3>
<p>In 1858, <a href="/wiki/William_Parker_Foulke">William Parker Foulke</a> discovered the first known American dinosaur, in <a href="/wiki/Marl">marl</a> pits in the small town of <a href="/wiki/Haddonfield,_New_Jersey">Haddonfield, New Jersey</a>. (Although
    fossils had been found before, their nature had not been correctly discerned.) The creature was named <em><a href="/wiki/Hadrosaurus">Hadrosaurus foulkii</a></em>. It was an extremely important find: <em>Hadrosaurus</em> was one of the first nearly
    complete dinosaur skeletons found (<a href="/wiki/Iguanodon#Gideon_Mantell,_Sir_Richard_Owen,_and_the_discovery_of_dinosaurs">the first</a> was in 1834, in <a href="/wiki/Maidstone">Maidstone, England</a>), and it was clearly a bipedal creature. This
    was a revolutionary discovery as, until that point, most scientists had believed dinosaurs walked on four feet, like other lizards. Foulke's discoveries sparked a wave of interests in dinosaurs in the United States, known as dinosaur mania.<sup><a href="#cite_note-weishampel06-56">[55]</a></sup></p>

<p>Dinosaur mania was exemplified by the fierce rivalry between <a href="/wiki/Edward_Drinker_Cope">Edward Drinker Cope</a> and <a href="/wiki/Othniel_Charles_Marsh">Othniel Charles Marsh</a>, both of whom raced to be the first to find new dinosaurs in what
    came to be known as the <a href="/wiki/Bone_Wars">Bone Wars</a>. This fight between the two scientists lasted for over 30 years, ending in 1897 when Cope died after spending his entire fortune on the dinosaur hunt. Unfortunately, many valuable dinosaur
    specimens were damaged or destroyed due to the pair's rough methods: for example, their diggers often used <a href="/wiki/Dynamite">dynamite</a> to unearth bones. Modern paleontologists would find such methods crude and unacceptable, since blasting
    easily destroys fossil and stratigraphic evidence. Despite their unrefined methods, the contributions of Cope and Marsh to paleontology were vast: Marsh unearthed 86 new species of dinosaur and Cope discovered 56, a total of 142 new species. Cope's
    collection is now at the American Museum of Natural History, while Marsh's is at the <a href="/wiki/Peabody_Museum_of_Natural_History">Peabody Museum of Natural History</a> at <a href="/wiki/Yale_University">Yale University</a>.<sup><a href="#cite_note-Holmes-57">[56]</a></sup></p>

<p>One of the best examples of soft-tissue impressions in a fossil dinosaur was discovered in the <a href="/wiki/Pietraroja_Formation">Pietraroia Plattenkalk</a> in southern <a href="/wiki/Italy">Italy</a>. The discovery was reported in 1998, and described
    the specimen of a small, juvenile coelurosaur, <em><a href="/wiki/Scipionyx">Scipionyx samniticus</a></em>. The fossil includes portions of the intestines, colon, liver, muscles, and windpipe of this dinosaur.<sup><a href="#cite_note-softtissue-65">[64]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the March 2005 issue of <em><a href="/wiki/Science_(journal)">Science</a></em>, the paleontologist <a href="/wiki/Mary_Higby_Schweitzer">Mary Higby Schweitzer</a> and her team announced the discovery of flexible material resembling actual soft tissue
    inside a 68-million-year-old <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> leg bone from the <a href="/wiki/Hell_Creek_Formation">Hell Creek Formation</a> in <a href="/wiki/Montana">Montana</a>. After recovery, the tissue was rehydrated by the science team.<sup><a href="#cite_note-Schweitzer2005-66">[65]</a></sup>    When the fossilized bone was treated over several weeks to remove mineral content from the fossilized bone-marrow cavity (a process called demineralization), Schweitzer found evidence of intact structures such as <a href="/wiki/Blood_vessel">blood vessels</a>,
    <a href="/wiki/Osteon">bone matrix</a>, and connective tissue (bone fibers). Scrutiny under the microscope further revealed that the putative dinosaur soft tissue had retained fine structures (microstructures) even at the cellular level. The exact
    nature and composition of this material, and the implications of Schweitzer's discovery, are not yet clear.<sup><a href="#cite_note-Schweitzer2005-66">[65]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2009, a team including Schweitzer announced that, using even more careful methodology, they had duplicated their results by finding similar soft tissue in a duck-billed dinosaur, <em><a href="/wiki/Brachylophosaurus">Brachylophosaurus canadensis</a></em>,
    found in the <a href="/wiki/Judith_River_Formation">Judith River Formation</a> of Montana. This included even more detailed tissue, down to preserved bone cells that seem to have visible remnants of nuclei and what seem to be red blood cells. Among
    other materials found in the bone was <a href="/wiki/Collagen">collagen</a>, as in the <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> bone. The type of collagen an animal has in its bones varies according to its <a href="/wiki/DNA">DNA</a> and, in both cases, this collagen
    was of the same type found in modern chickens and ostriches.<sup><a href="#cite_note-67">[66]</a></sup></p>

    are too fragmentary to tell if it was a dinosaur or only a close relative.<sup><a href="#cite_note-nyasasaurus-83">[82]</a></sup> Paleontologist Max C. Langer <em>et al.</em> (2018) determined that
    <em><a href="/wiki/Staurikosaurus">Staurikosaurus</a></em> from the <a href="/wiki/Santa_Maria_Formation">Santa Maria Formation</a> dates to 233.23&nbsp;million years ago, making it older in geologic age than <em>Eoraptor</em>.<sup><a href="#cite_note-langer18-84">[83]</a></sup></p>
<p>When dinosaurs appeared, they were not the dominant terrestrial animals. The terrestrial habitats were occupied by various types of <a href="/wiki/Archosauromorpha">archosauromorphs</a> and <a href="/wiki/Therapsid">therapsids</a>, like
    <a href="/wiki/Cynodont">cynodonts</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rhynchosaur">rhynchosaurs</a>.

First, at about 215&nbsp;million years ago, a variety of
    <a href="/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)">basal</a> archosauromorphs, including the <a href="/wiki/Protorosauria">protorosaurs</a>, became extinct. This was followed by the Triassic&ndash;Jurassic extinction event (about 201&nbsp;million years ago), that
    saw the end of most of the other groups of early archosaurs, like aetosaurs, ornithosuchids, <a href="/wiki/Phytosaur">phytosaurs</a>, and rauisuchians. Rhynchosaurs and <a href="/wiki/Dicynodont">dicynodonts</a> survived (at least in some areas)

</div>
<p>Dinosaur evolution after the Triassic followed changes in vegetation and the location of continents. In the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic, the continents were connected as the single landmass <a href="/wiki/Pangaea">Pangaea</a>, and there was a worldwide
    dinosaur fauna mostly composed of <a href="/wiki/Coelophysoidea">coelophysoid</a> carnivores and early sauropodomorph herbivores.<sup><a href="#cite_note-HCL04-89">[88]</a></sup><a href="/wiki/Gymnosperm">Gymnosperm</a> plants (particularly <a href="/wiki/Pinophyta">conifers</a>),
    a potential food source, <a href="/wiki/Evolutionary_radiation">radiated</a> in the Late Triassic. Early sauropodomorphs did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food in the mouth, and so must have employed other means of breaking down
    food farther along the digestive tract.<sup><a href="#cite_note-FS04-90">[89]</a></sup> The general homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into the Middle and Late Jurassic, where most localities had predators consisting of <a href="/wiki/Ceratosauria">ceratosaurians</a>,
    <a href="/wiki/Megalosauroidea">megalosauroids</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Allosauroidea">allosauroids</a>, and herbivores consisting of stegosaurian ornithischians and large sauropods. Examples of this include the <a href="/wiki/Morrison_Formation">Morrison Formation</a>    of <a href="/wiki/North_America">North America</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tendaguru_Formation">Tendaguru Beds</a> of Tanzania. Dinosaurs in China show some differences, with specialized <a href="/wiki/Metriacanthosauridae">metriacanthosaurid</a> theropods
    and unusual, long-necked sauropods like <em><a href="/wiki/Mamenchisaurus">Mamenchisaurus</a></em>.
    <sup><a href="#cite_note-HCL04-89">[88]</a></sup> Ankylosaurians and ornithopods were also becoming more common, but primitive sauropodomorphs had become extinct. Conifers and <a href="/wiki/Pteridophyte">pteridophytes</a> were the most common plants.
    Sauropods, like earlier sauropodomorphs, were not oral processors, but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food in the mouth, including potential <a href="/wiki/Cheek">cheek</a>-like organs to keep food in the mouth, and jaw
    motions to grind food.<sup><a href="#cite_note-FS04-90">[89]</a></sup> Another notable evolutionary event of the Jurassic was the appearance of true birds, descended from maniraptoran coelurosaurians.<sup><a href="#cite_note-KP04-12">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>By the <a href="/wiki/Early_Cretaceous">Early Cretaceous</a> and the ongoing breakup of Pangaea, dinosaurs were becoming strongly differentiated by landmass. The earliest part of this time saw the spread of ankylosaurians, <a href="/wiki/Iguanodontia">iguanodontians</a>,
    and <a href="/wiki/Brachiosauridae">brachiosaurids</a> through Europe, North America, and northern <a href="/wiki/Africa">Africa</a>.

In <a href="/wiki/Asia">Asia</a>, maniraptoran coelurosaurians
    like <a href="/wiki/Dromaeosauridae">dromaeosaurids</a>, <a href="/wiki/Troodontidae">troodontids</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Oviraptorosauria">oviraptorosaurians</a> became the common theropods, and <a href="/wiki/Ankylosauridae">ankylosaurids</a> and
    early ceratopsians like <em>Psittacosaurus</em> became important herbivores. Meanwhile, <a href="/wiki/Australia">Australia</a> was home to a fauna of basal ankylosaurians, <a href="/wiki/Hypsilophodont">hypsilophodonts</a>, and iguanodontians.<sup><a href="#cite_note-HCL04-89">[88]</a></sup>    The stegosaurians appear to have gone extinct at some point in the late Early Cretaceous or early <a href="/wiki/Late_Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a>. A major change in the Early Cretaceous, which would be amplified in the Late Cretaceous, was the
    evolution of <a href="/wiki/Flowering_plant">flowering plants</a>. At the same time, several groups of dinosaurian herbivores evolved more sophisticated ways to orally process food. Ceratopsians developed a method of slicing with teeth stacked on
    each other in batteries, and iguanodontians refined a method of grinding with <a href="/wiki/Dinosaur_tooth#Dental_batteries">dental batteries</a>, taken to its extreme in hadrosaurids.<sup><a href="#cite_note-FS04-90">[89]</a></sup> Some sauropods
    also evolved tooth batteries, best exemplified by the rebbachisaurid <em><a href="/wiki/Nigersaurus">Nigersaurus</a></em>. <sup><a href="#cite_note-serenoetal07-91">[90]</a></sup></p>
<p>There were three general dinosaur faunas in the Late Cretaceous. In the northern continents of North America and Asia, the major theropods were <a href="/wiki/Tyrannosauridae">tyrannosaurids</a> and various types of smaller maniraptoran theropods, with
    a predominantly ornithischian herbivore assemblage of hadrosaurids, ceratopsians, ankylosaurids, and pachycephalosaurians. In the southern continents that had made up the now-splitting supercontinent <a href="/wiki/Gondwana">Gondwana</a>,
    <a href="/wiki/Abelisauridae">abelisaurids</a> were the common theropods, and titanosaurian sauropods the common herbivores. Finally, in Europe, dromaeosaurids, <a href="/wiki/Rhabdodontidae">rhabdodontid</a> iguanodontians, <a href="/wiki/Nodosauridae">nodosaurid</a>    ankylosaurians, and titanosaurian sauropods were prevalent.<sup><a href="#cite_note-HCL04-89">[88]</a></sup> Flowering plants were greatly radiating,<sup><a href="#cite_note-FS04-90">[89]</a></sup> with the first grasses appearing by the end of the

<p>Dinosaurs belong to a group known as archosaurs, which also includes modern crocodilians. Within the archosaur group, dinosaurs are differentiated most noticeably by their gait. Dinosaur legs extend directly beneath the body, whereas the legs of lizards
    and crocodilians sprawl out to either side.<sup><a href="#cite_note-B012-28">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>Collectively, dinosaurs as a clade are divided into two primary branches, Saurischia and Ornithischia. Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia, while Ornithischia includes all
    <a href="/wiki/Taxon">taxa</a> sharing a more recent common ancestor with <em>Triceratops</em> than with Saurischia. Anatomically, these two groups can be distinguished most noticeably by their <a href="/wiki/Pelvis">pelvic</a> structure. Early saurischians&mdash;"lizard-hipped",
    from the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greek">Greek</a><em><em>sauros</em></em> (&sigma;&alpha;ῦ&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;) meaning "lizard" and <em><em>ischion</em></em> (ἰ&sigma;&chi;ί&omicron;&nu;) meaning "hip joint"&mdash;retained the hip structure of their
    ancestors, with a pubis bone directed <a href="/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location">cranially</a>, or forward.<sup><a href="#cite_note-MJB00-35">[34]</a></sup> This basic form was modified by rotating the pubis backward to varying degrees in several
    groups (<em>Herrerasaurus</em>,<sup><a href="#cite_note-GSP88-98">[97]</a></sup> therizinosauroids,<sup><a href="#cite_note-clarketal2004-99">[98]</a></sup> dromaeosaurids,<sup><a href="#cite_note-MAPM04-100">[99]</a></sup> and birds<sup><a href="#cite_note-KP04-12">[11]</a></sup>).
    Saurischia includes the theropods (exclusively bipedal and with a wide variety of diets) and sauropodomorphs (long-necked herbivores which include advanced, quadrupedal groups).<sup><a href="#cite_note-theropods-27">[26]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-sauropodomorphs-101">[100]</a></sup></p>
<p>By contrast, ornithischians&mdash;"bird-hipped", from the Greek <em>ornitheios</em> (ὀ&rho;&nu;ί&theta;&epsilon;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;) meaning "of a bird" and <em>ischion</em> (ἰ&sigma;&chi;ί&omicron;&nu;) meaning "hip joint"&mdash;had a pelvis that
    superficially resembled a bird's pelvis: the pubic bone was oriented caudally (rear-pointing). Unlike birds, the ornithischian pubis also usually had an additional forward-pointing process. Ornithischia includes a variety of species that were primarily
    herbivores.
</p>
<p>Despite the terms "bird hip" (Ornithischia) and "lizard hip" (Saurischia), birds are not part of Ornithischia. Birds instead belong to Saurischia, the &ldquo;lizard-hipped&rdquo; dinosaurs&mdash;birds evolved from earlier dinosaurs with "lizard hips".

    <a href="/wiki/Feather">feathers</a>, impressions of skin, <a href="/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)">internal organs</a> and other <a href="/wiki/Soft_tissue">soft tissues</a>.<sup><a href="#cite_note-softtissue-65">[64]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-Schweitzer2005-66">[65]</a></sup>    Many fields of study contribute to our understanding of dinosaurs, including <a href="/wiki/Physics">physics</a> (especially <a href="/wiki/Biomechanics">biomechanics</a>), <a href="/wiki/Chemistry">chemistry</a>, <a href="/wiki/Biology">biology</a>,
    and the <a href="/wiki/Earth_science">Earth sciences</a> (of which <a href="/wiki/Paleontology">paleontology</a> is a sub-discipline).<sup><a href="#cite_note-alexander2006-103">[102]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-dinobiology-104">[103]</a></sup>    Two topics of particular interest and study have been dinosaur size and behavior.<sup><a href="#cite_note-105">[104]</a></sup></p>
<h3>Size</h3>
<div>Main article: <a href="/wiki/Dinosaur_size">Dinosaur size</a></div>
<p>Current evidence suggests that dinosaur average size varied through the Triassic, Early Jurassic, Late Jurassic and Cretaceous.<sup><a href="#cite_note-Sereno1999-80">[79]</a></sup> Predatory theropod dinosaurs, which occupied most terrestrial carnivore
    niches during the Mesozoic, most often fall into the 100 to 1000&nbsp;kg (220 to 2200&nbsp;lb) category when sorted by estimated weight into categories based on <a href="/wiki/Order_of_magnitude">order of magnitude</a>, whereas
    <a href="/wiki/Holocene">recent</a> predatory carnivoran mammals peak in the 10 to 100&nbsp;kg (22 to 220&nbsp;lb) category.<sup><a href="#cite_note-JF93-106">[105]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Mode_(statistics)">mode</a> of Mesozoic dinosaur body
    masses is between 1 to 10 metric tons (1.1 to 11.0 short tons).<sup><a href="#cite_note-Peczkis1994-107">[106]</a></sup> This contrasts sharply with the average size of Cenozoic mammals, estimated by the <a href="/wiki/National_Museum_of_Natural_History">National Museum of Natural History</a>    as about 2 to 5&nbsp;kg (4.4 to 11.0&nbsp;lb).<sup><a href="#cite_note-NMNH-108">[107]</a></sup></p>
<p>The sauropods were the largest and heaviest dinosaurs. For much of the dinosaur era, the smallest sauropods were larger than anything else in their habitat, and the largest was an order of magnitude more massive than anything else that has since walked
    the Earth. Giant prehistoric mammals such as <em><a href="/wiki/Paraceratherium">Paraceratherium</a></em> (the largest land mammal ever) were dwarfed by the giant sauropods, and only modern whales approach or surpass them in size.<sup><a href="#cite_note-sander2011-109">[108]</a></sup>    There are several proposed advantages for the large size of sauropods, including protection from predation, reduction of energy use, and longevity, but it may be that the most important advantage was dietary. Large animals are more efficient at digestion
    than small animals, because food spends more time in their digestive systems. This also permits them to subsist on food with lower nutritive value than smaller animals. Sauropod remains are mostly found in rock formations interpreted as dry or seasonally
    dry, and the ability to eat large quantities of low-nutrient browse would have been advantageous in such environments.<sup><a href="#cite_note-KC06-110">[109]</a></sup></p>
<h4>Largest and smallest</h4>
<p>Scientists will probably never be certain of the <a href="/wiki/Largest_organisms">largest and smallest dinosaurs</a> to have ever existed. This is because only a tiny percentage of animals were ever fossilized and most of these remain buried in the earth.
    Few of the specimens that are recovered are complete skeletons, and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare. Rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar, better-known species is an inexact
    art, and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is, at best, a process of educated guesswork.<sup><a href="#cite_note-111">[110]</a></sup></p>

<p>There were larger dinosaurs, but knowledge of them is based entirely on a small number of fragmentary fossils. Most of the largest herbivorous specimens on record were discovered in the 1970s or later, and include the massive <em>Argentinosaurus</em>,
    which may have weighed 80000 to 100000&nbsp;kilograms (90 to 110&nbsp;short tons) and reached lengths of 30 to 40 meters (98 to 131&nbsp;ft); some of the longest were the 33.5-meter (110&nbsp;ft) long <em>Diplodocus hallorum</em><sup><a href="#cite_note-KC06-110">[109]</a></sup>    (formerly <em>Seismosaurus</em>), the 33-to-34-meter (108 to 112&nbsp;ft) long <em><a href="/wiki/Supersaurus">Supersaurus</a></em>,<sup><a href="#cite_note-LHW07-117">[116]</a></sup> and 37-meter (121&nbsp;ft) long <em>Patagotitan</em>; and the tallest,
    the 18-meter (59&nbsp;ft) tall <em><a href="/wiki/Sauroposeidon">Sauroposeidon</a></em>, which could have reached a sixth-floor window. The heaviest and longest dinosaur may have been <em><a href="/wiki/Maraapunisaurus">Maraapunisaurus</a></em>, known
    only from a now lost partial vertebral <a href="/wiki/Vertebra#Structure">neural arch</a> described in 1878. Extrapolating from the illustration of this bone, the animal may have been 58 meters (190&nbsp;ft) long and weighed 122400 kg (270000 lb).<sup><a href="#cite_note-KC06-110">[109]</a></sup>    However, as no further evidence of sauropods of this size has been found, and the discoverer, Cope, had made typographic errors before, it is likely to have been an extreme overestimation.
    <sup><a href="#cite_note-118">[117]</a></sup></p>
<p>The largest carnivorous dinosaur was <em><a href="/wiki/Spinosaurus">Spinosaurus</a></em>, reaching a length of 12.6 to 18 meters (41 to 59&nbsp;ft), and weighing 7 to 20.9 metric tons (7.7 to 23.0 short tons).<sup><a href="#cite_note-SMBM06-119">[118]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-TH07-120">[119]</a></sup>    Other large carnivorous theropods included <em><a href="/wiki/Giganotosaurus">Giganotosaurus</a></em>, <em><a href="/wiki/Carcharodontosaurus">Carcharodontosaurus</a></em> and <em><a href="/wiki/Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a></em>.<sup><a href="#cite_note-TH07-120">[119]</a></sup><em><a href="/wiki/Therizinosaurus">Therizinosaurus</a></em>    and <em><a href="/wiki/Deinocheirus">Deinocheirus</a></em> were among the tallest of the theropods. The largest ornithischian dinosaur was probably the hadrosaurid <em><a href="/wiki/Shantungosaurus">Shantungosaurus giganteus</a></em> which measured
    16.6 meters (54&nbsp;ft).<sup><a href="#cite_note-121">[120]</a></sup> The largest individuals may have weighed as much as 16 metric tons (18 short tons).<sup><a href="#cite_note-122">[121]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Behavior</h3>

            A nesting ground of the hadrosaur <em><a href="/wiki/Maiasaura">Maiasaura peeblesorum</a></em> was discovered in 1978</div>
    </div>
</div>
<p>Many modern birds are highly social, often found living in flocks. There is general agreement that some behaviors that are common in birds, as well as in <a href="/wiki/Crocodile">crocodiles</a> (closest living relatives of birds), were also common among
    extinct dinosaur groups. Interpretations of behavior in fossil species are generally based on the pose of skeletons and their <a href="/wiki/Habitat_(ecology)">habitat</a>, <a href="/wiki/Computer_simulation">computer simulations</a> of their biomechanics,
    and comparisons with modern animals in similar ecological niches.<sup><a href="#cite_note-alexander2006-103">[102]</a></sup></p>
<p>The first potential evidence for <a href="/wiki/Herd">herding</a> or <a href="/wiki/Flocking_(behavior)">flocking</a> as a widespread behavior common to many dinosaur groups in addition to birds was the 1878 discovery of 31&nbsp;<em>Iguanodon</em>, ornithischians
    that were then thought to have perished together in <a href="/wiki/Bernissart">Bernissart</a>, <a href="/wiki/Belgium">Belgium</a>, after they fell into a deep, flooded <a href="/wiki/Sinkhole">sinkhole</a> and drowned.<sup><a href="#cite_note-Yans-128">[127]</a></sup>    Other mass-death sites have been discovered subsequently. Those, along with multiple trackways, suggest that gregarious behavior was common in many early dinosaur species. Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that duck-billed
    (hadrosaurids) may have moved in great herds, like the <a href="/wiki/American_bison">American bison</a> or the African <a href="/wiki/Springbok">Springbok</a>. Sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different
    species, at least in <a href="/wiki/Oxfordshire">Oxfordshire</a>, England,<sup><a href="#cite_note-Day2002-129">[128]</a></sup> although there is no evidence for specific herd structures.<sup><a href="#cite_note-JLW05-130">[129]</a></sup> Congregating
    into herds may have evolved for defense, for <a href="/wiki/Bird_migration">migratory</a> purposes, or to provide protection for young. There is evidence that many types of slow-growing dinosaurs, including various theropods, sauropods, ankylosaurians,
    ornithopods, and ceratopsians, formed aggregations of immature individuals. One example is a site in <a href="/wiki/Inner_Mongolia">Inner Mongolia</a> that has yielded remains of over 20 <em><a href="/wiki/Sinornithomimus">Sinornithomimus</a></em>,
    from one to seven years old. This assemblage is interpreted as a social group that was trapped in mud.<sup><a href="#cite_note-DVetal08sino-131">[130]</a></sup> The interpretation of dinosaurs as gregarious has also extended to depicting carnivorous
    theropods as <a href="/wiki/Pack_hunter">pack hunters</a> working together to bring down large prey.<sup><a href="#cite_note-LG93-132">[131]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-maxwell&amp;ostrom1995-133">[132]</a></sup> However, this lifestyle is uncommon
    among modern birds, crocodiles, and other reptiles, and the <a href="/wiki/Taphonomy">taphonomic</a> evidence suggesting mammal-like pack hunting in such theropods as <em>Deinonychus</em> and <em><a href="/wiki/Allosaurus">Allosaurus</a></em> can
    also be interpreted as the results of fatal disputes between feeding animals, as is seen in many modern diapsid predators.<sup><a href="#cite_note-RB07-134">[133]</a></sup></p>

<p>Comparisons between the <a href="/wiki/Sclerotic_ring">scleral rings</a> of dinosaurs and modern birds and reptiles have been used to infer daily activity patterns of dinosaurs. Although it has been suggested that most dinosaurs were active during the
    day, these comparisons have shown that small predatory dinosaurs such as dromaeosaurids, <em><a href="/wiki/Juravenator">Juravenator</a></em>, and <em><a href="/wiki/Megapnosaurus">Megapnosaurus</a></em> were likely <a href="/wiki/Nocturnal">nocturnal</a>.
    Large and medium-sized herbivorous and omnivorous dinosaurs such as ceratopsians, sauropodomorphs, hadrosaurids, ornithomimosaurs may have been <a href="/wiki/Cathemeral">cathemeral</a>, active during short intervals throughout the day, although the

<p>Based on fossil evidence from dinosaurs such as <em><a href="/wiki/Oryctodromeus">Oryctodromeus</a></em>, some ornithischian species seem to have led a partially <a href="/wiki/Fossorial">fossorial</a> (burrowing) lifestyle.<sup><a href="#cite_note-VMK07-140">[139]</a></sup>    Many modern birds are <a href="/wiki/Arboreal">arboreal</a> (tree climbing), and this was also true of many Mesozoic birds, especially the enantiornithines.<sup><a href="#cite_note-141">[140]</a></sup> While some early bird-like species may have already

<p>Modern birds are known to <a href="/wiki/Animal_communication">communicate</a> using visual and auditory signals, and the wide diversity of visual display structures among fossil dinosaur groups, such as horns, frills, crests, sails, and feathers, suggests
    that visual communication has always been important in dinosaur biology.<sup><a href="#cite_note-senter2008-145">[144]</a></sup> Reconstruction of the plumage color of <em>Anchiornis</em>, suggest the importance of color in visual communication in
    non-avian dinosaurs.<sup><a href="#cite_note-Li2010-146">[145]</a></sup> The evolution of dinosaur vocalization is less certain. Paleontologist Phil Senter has suggested that non-avian dinosaurs relied mostly on visual displays and possibly non-vocal
    acoustic sounds like hissing, jaw grinding or clapping, splashing and wing beating (possible in winged maniraptoran dinosaurs). He states they were unlikely to have been capable of vocalizing since their closest relatives, crocodilians and birds,
    use different means to vocalize, the former via the <a href="/wiki/Larynx">larynx</a> and the latter through the unique <a href="/wiki/Syrinx_(bird_anatomy)">syrinx</a>, suggesting they evolved independently and their common ancestor was mute.<sup><a href="#cite_note-senter2008-145">[144]</a></sup></p>
<p>The earliest remains of a syrinx, which has enough mineral content for fossilization, was found in a specimen of the duck-like <em><a href="/wiki/Vegavis">Vegavis iaai</a></em> dated 69 &ndash;66&nbsp;million years ago, and this organ is unlikely to have
    existed in non-avian dinosaurs. However, in contrast to Senter, other researchers have suggested that dinosaurs could vocalize and that the syrinx-based vocal system of birds evolved from a larynx-based one, rather than the two systems evolving independently.<sup><a href="#cite_note-Clarke2016-147">[146]</a></sup>    A 2016 study suggests that some dinosaurs produced closed mouth vocalizations like cooing, hooting and booming. These occur in both reptiles and birds and involve inflating the esophagus or tracheal pouches. Such vocalizations evolved independently
    in extant archosaurs numerous times, following increases in body size.<sup><a href="#cite_note-Tobias2016-148">[147]</a></sup> The crests of the <a href="/wiki/Lambeosaurini">Lambeosaurini</a> and nasal chambers of ankylosaurids have been suggested

</div>
<p>All dinosaurs laid <a href="/wiki/Amniote">amniotic eggs</a>. Dinosaur eggs were usually laid in a nest. Most species create somewhat elaborate nests which can be cups, domes, plates, beds scrapes, mounds, or burrows.<sup><a href="#cite_note-Hansell-151">[150]</a></sup>    Some species of modern bird have no nests; the cliff-nesting <a href="/wiki/Common_murre">common guillemot</a> lays its eggs on bare rock, and male <a href="/wiki/Emperor_penguin">emperor penguins</a> keep eggs between their body and feet. Primitive
    birds and many non-avialan dinosaurs often lay eggs in communal nests, with males primarily incubating the eggs. While modern birds have only one functional <a href="/wiki/Oviduct">oviduct</a> and lay one egg at a time, more primitive birds and dinosaurs
    had two oviducts, like crocodiles. Some non-avialan dinosaurs, such as <em><a href="/wiki/Troodon">Troodon</a></em>, exhibited iterative laying, where the adult might lay a pair of eggs every one or two days, and then ensured simultaneous hatching
    by delaying <a href="/wiki/Broodiness#Broodiness_in_non-avian_animals">brooding</a> until all eggs were laid.<sup><a href="#cite_note-Varrichioetal.02-152">[151]</a></sup></p>
<p>When laying eggs, females grow a special type of bone between the hard outer bone and the <a href="/wiki/Bone_marrow">marrow</a> of their limbs. This medullary bone, which is rich in <a href="/wiki/Calcium">calcium</a>, is used to make eggshells. A discovery
    of features in a <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> skeleton provided evidence of medullary bone in extinct dinosaurs and, for the first time, allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a fossil dinosaur specimen. Further research has found medullary bone
    in the carnosaur <em>Allosaurus</em> and the ornithopod <em><a href="/wiki/Tenontosaurus">Tenontosaurus</a></em>. Because the line of dinosaurs that includes <em>Allosaurus</em> and <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> diverged from the line that led to <em>Tenontosaurus</em>    very early in the evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that the production of medullary tissue is a general characteristic of all dinosaurs.<sup><a href="#cite_note-LW08-153">[152]</a></sup></p>

<p>Another widespread trait among modern birds (but see below in regards to fossil groups and extant <a href="/wiki/Megapodes">megapodes</a>) is parental care for young after hatching. <a href="/wiki/Jack_Horner_(paleontologist)">Jack Horner's</a> 1978 discovery
    of a <em><a href="/wiki/Maiasaura">Maiasaura</a></em> ("good mother lizard") nesting ground in Montana demonstrated that parental care continued long after birth among ornithopods.<sup><a href="#cite_note-HM79-154">[153]</a></sup> A specimen of the

    without teeth, indicating that some parental care was required to feed the young dinosaurs.<sup><a href="#cite_note-Reiszetal05-157">[156]</a></sup> Trackways have also confirmed parental behavior among ornithopods from the

For instance, non-<a href="/wiki/Euornithes">ornithuromorph</a>    birds have been abundantly demonstrated to have had slow growth rates, <a href="/wiki/Megapode">megapode</a>-like egg burying behavior and the ability to fly soon after birth.<sup><a href="#cite_note-159">[158]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-160">[159]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-161">[160]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-162">[161]</a></sup>    Both <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> and <em>Troodon</em> had juveniles with clear superprecociality and likely occupying different ecological niches than the adults.<sup><a href="#cite_note-Varrichioetal.02-152">[151]</a></sup> Superprecociality has been
    inferred for sauropods.<sup><a href="#cite_note-163">[162]</a></sup></p>
<p>Genital structures are unlikely to fossilize as they lack scales that may allow preservation via pigmentation or residual calcium phosphate salts. In 2021, the best preserved specimen of a dinosaur's <a href="/wiki/Cloacal_vent">cloacal vent</a> exterior
    was described for <em><a href="/wiki/Psittacosaurus">Psittacosaurus</a></em>, demonstrating lateral swellings similar to crocodylian musk glands used in social displays by both sexes and pigmented regions which could also reflect a signalling function.
    However, this specimen on its own does not offer enough information to determine whether this dinosaur had sexual signalling functions; it only supports the possibility. Cloacal visual signalling can occur in either males or females in living birds,
    making it unlikely to be useful to determine sex for extinct dinosaurs.<sup><a href="#cite_note-cloacal-vent-164">[163]</a></sup></p>

<p>Because both modern crocodilians and birds have four-chambered hearts (albeit modified in crocodilians), it is likely that this is a trait shared by all archosaurs, including all dinosaurs.<sup><a href="#cite_note-CH04-165">[164]</a></sup> While all modern
    birds have high metabolisms and are <a href="/wiki/Endotherm">endothermic</a> ("warm-blooded"), a vigorous debate has been ongoing since the 1960s regarding how far back in the dinosaur lineage this trait extended. Various researchers have supported

<p>After non-avian dinosaurs were discovered, paleontologists first posited that they were ectothermic. This was used to imply that the ancient dinosaurs were relatively slow, sluggish organisms, even though many modern reptiles are fast and light-footed
    despite relying on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature. The idea of dinosaurs as ectothermic remained a prevalent view until <a href="/wiki/Robert_T._Bakker">Robert T. Bakker</a>, an early proponent of dinosaur endothermy,
    published an influential paper on the topic in 1968. Bakker specifically used anatomical and ecological evidence to argue that sauropods, which had hitherto been depicted as sprawling aquatic animals with their tails dragging on the ground, were endotherms
    that lived vigorous, terrestrial lives. In 1972, Bakker expanded on his arguments based on energy requirements and predator-prey ratios. This was one of the seminal results that led to the Dinosaur renaissance.<sup><a href="#cite_note-bakker1968-59">[58]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-bakker1972-60">[59]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-taylor2010-62">[61]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-parsons2001-171">[170]</a></sup></p>

<p>The size and shape of the brain can be partly reconstructed based on the surrounding bones. In 1896, Marsh calculated ratios between brain weight and body weight of seven species of dinosaurs, showing that the brain of dinosaurs was proportionally smaller
    than in today's crocodiles, and that the brain of <em>Stegosaurus</em> was smaller than in any living land vertebrate. This contributed to the widespread public notion of dinosaurs as being sluggish and extraordinarily stupid. Harry Jerison, in 1973,
    showed that proportionally smaller brains are expected at larger body sizes, and that brain size in dinosaurs was not smaller than expected when compared to living reptiles.<sup><a href="#cite_note-russell1997-199">[198]</a></sup> Later research showed
    that relative brain size progressively increased during the evolution of theropods, with the highest intelligence &ndash; comparable to that of modern birds &ndash; calculated for the troodontid <em><a href="/wiki/Troodon">Troodon</a></em>.

<p>Feathers are one of the most recognizable characteristics of modern birds, and a trait that was also shared by several non-avian dinosaurs. Based on the current distribution of fossil evidence, it appears that feathers were an ancestral dinosaurian trait,
    though one that may have been selectively lost in some species.<sup><a href="#cite_note-switeknature-209">[208]</a></sup> Direct fossil evidence of feathers or feather-like structures has been discovered in a diverse array of species in many non-avian
    dinosaur groups,<sup><a href="#cite_note-NYT-20161208-64">[63]</a></sup> both among saurischians and ornithischians. Simple, branched, feather-like structures are known from <a href="/wiki/Heterodontosauridae">heterodontosaurids</a>, primitive
    <a href="/wiki/Neornithischia">neornithischians</a>, <sup><a href="#cite_note-Godefroit2014-210">[209]</a></sup> and theropods,<sup><a href="#cite_note-Xuetal2004-211">[210]</a></sup> and primitive ceratopsians. Evidence for true, vaned feathers similar
    to the flight feathers of modern birds has been found only in the theropod subgroup Maniraptora, which includes oviraptorosaurs, troodontids, dromaeosaurids, and birds.<sup><a href="#cite_note-KP04-12">[11]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-GC06-212">[211]</a></sup>    Feather-like structures known as <a href="/wiki/Pterosaur#Pycnofibers">pycnofibres</a> have also been found in pterosaurs,<sup><a href="#cite_note-kellneretal2009-213">[212]</a></sup> suggesting the possibility that feather-like filaments may have
    been common in the bird lineage and evolved before the appearance of dinosaurs themselves.<sup><a href="#cite_note-switeknature-209">[208]</a></sup> Research into the genetics of <a href="/wiki/American_alligator">American alligators</a> has also
    revealed that crocodylian <a href="/wiki/Scute">scutes</a> do possess feather-keratins during embryonic development, but these keratins are not expressed by the animals before hatching.<sup><a href="#cite_note-AlibL2006-214">[213]</a></sup></p>
<p><em><a href="/wiki/Archaeopteryx">Archaeopteryx</a></em> was the first fossil found that revealed a potential connection between dinosaurs and birds. It is considered a <a href="/wiki/Transitional_fossil">transitional fossil</a>, in that it displays features
    of both groups. Brought to light just two years after <a href="/wiki/Charles_Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>'s seminal <em><a href="/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species">On the Origin of Species</a></em> (1859), its discovery spurred the nascent debate between
    proponents of <a href="/wiki/Evolutionary_biology">evolutionary biology</a> and <a href="/wiki/Creationism">creationism</a>. This early bird is so dinosaur-like that, without a clear impression of feathers in the surrounding rock, at least one specimen
    was mistaken for the small theropod <em><a href="/wiki/Compsognathus">Compsognathus</a></em>. <sup><a href="#cite_note-PW88-215">[214]</a></sup> Since the 1990s, a number of additional feathered dinosaurs have been found, providing even stronger evidence
    of the close relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds. Most of these specimens were unearthed in the <a href="/wiki/Lagerst%C3%A4tten">lagerst&auml;tte</a> of the Yixian Formation, <a href="/wiki/Liaoning">Liaoning</a>, northeastern China,
    which was part of an island continent during the Cretaceous. Though feathers have been found in only a few locations, it is possible that non-avian dinosaurs elsewhere in the world were also feathered. The lack of widespread fossil evidence for feathered
    non-avian dinosaurs may be because delicate features like skin and feathers are seldom preserved by fossilization and thus often absent from the fossil record.
    <sup><a href="#cite_note-Schweitzeretal1999-216">[215]</a></sup></p>
<p>The description of feathered dinosaurs has not been without controversy; perhaps the most vocal critics have been Alan Feduccia and Theagarten Lingham-Soliar, who have proposed that some purported feather-like fossils are the result of the decomposition
    of collagenous fiber that underlaid the dinosaurs' skin,<sup><a href="#cite_note-TLS03-217">[216]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-FLH05-218">[217]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-LSFX07-219">[218]</a></sup> and that maniraptoran dinosaurs with
    vaned feathers were not actually dinosaurs, but convergent with dinosaurs.<sup><a href="#cite_note-AF02-208">[207]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-FLH05-218">[217]</a></sup> However, their views have for the most part not been accepted by other
    researchers, to the point that the scientific nature of Feduccia's proposals has been questioned.<sup><a href="#cite_note-Prum2003-220">[219]</a></sup></p>
<h3>Skeleton</h3>
<p>Because feathers are often associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the missing link between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent another important line of evidence
    for paleontologists. Areas of the skeleton with important similarities include the neck, pubis, <a href="/wiki/Wrist">wrist</a> (semi-lunate <a href="/wiki/Carpal">carpal</a>), arm and <a href="/wiki/Shoulder_girdle">pectoral girdle</a>, furcula (wishbone),
    and <a href="/wiki/Keel_(bird_anatomy)">breast bone</a>. Comparison of bird and dinosaur skeletons through cladistic analysis strengthens the case for the link.<sup><a href="#cite_note-archaeopteryxucmp-221">[220]</a></sup></p>

<p>Large meat-eating dinosaurs had a complex system of air sacs similar to those found in modern birds, according to a 2005 investigation led by Patrick M. O'Connor. The lungs of theropod dinosaurs (carnivores that walked on two legs and had bird-like feet)
    likely pumped air into hollow sacs in their skeletons, as is the case in birds. "What was once formally considered unique to birds was present in some form in the ancestors of birds", O'Connor said.<sup><a href="#cite_note-OConnorClaessens2005-222">[221]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-223">[222]</a></sup>    In 2008, scientists described <em><a href="/wiki/Aerosteon">Aerosteon riocoloradensis</a></em>, the skeleton of which supplies the strongest evidence to date of a dinosaur with a bird-like breathing system. <a href="/wiki/CT_scan">CT scanning</a>    of <em>Aerosteon'</em>s fossil bones revealed evidence for the existence of air sacs within the animal's body cavity.<sup><a href="#cite_note-Sereno2008-186">[185]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-newswise2-224">[223]</a></sup></p>
<h3>Behavioral evidence</h3>
<p>Fossils of the troodonts <em><a href="/wiki/Mei_long">Mei</a></em> and <em><a href="/wiki/Sinornithoides">Sinornithoides</a></em> demonstrate that some dinosaurs slept with their heads tucked under their arms.<sup><a href="#cite_note-XUNorell2004-225">[224]</a></sup>    This behavior, which may have helped to keep the head warm, is also characteristic of modern birds. Several <a href="/wiki/Deinonychosauria">deinonychosaur</a> and oviraptorosaur specimens have also been found preserved on top of their nests, likely
    brooding in a bird-like manner.<sup><a href="#cite_note-norell1995-226">[225]</a></sup> The ratio between egg volume and body mass of adults among these dinosaurs suggest that the eggs were primarily brooded by the male, and that the young were highly
    precocial, similar to many modern ground-dwelling birds.<sup><a href="#cite_note-Varricchioetal2008-227">[226]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some dinosaurs are known to have used <a href="/wiki/Gizzard">gizzard</a> stones like modern birds. These stones are swallowed by animals to aid digestion and break down food and hard fibers once they enter the stomach. When found in association with
    fossils, gizzard stones are called gastroliths.<sup><a href="#cite_note-wings2007-228">[227]</a></sup></p>
<h2>Extinction of major groups</h2>
<div>Main article: <a href="/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event">Cretaceous&ndash;Paleogene extinction event</a></div>
<p>All non-avian dinosaurs and most lineages of birds<sup><a href="#cite_note-longrich2011-229">[228]</a></sup> became extinct in a <a href="/wiki/Extinction_event">mass extinction event</a>, called the <a href="/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event">Cretaceous&ndash;Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event</a>,
    at the end of the Cretaceous period. Above the <a href="/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_boundary">Cretaceous&ndash;Paleogene boundary</a>, which has been dated to 66.038 &plusmn; 0.025 million years ago,<sup><a href="#cite_note-renne2013-230">[229]</a></sup>    fossils of non-avian dinosaurs disappear abruptly; the absence of dinosaur fossils was historically used to assign rocks to the ensuing <a href="/wiki/Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a>. The nature of the event that caused this mass extinction has been extensively
    studied since the 1970s, leading to the development of two mechanisms that are thought to have played major roles: an extraterrestrial <a href="/wiki/Impact_event">impact event</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Yucat%C3%A1n_Peninsula">Yucat&aacute;n Peninsula</a>,
    along with <a href="/wiki/Flood_basalt">flood basalt</a> volcanism in India. However, the specific mechanisms of the extinction event and the extent of its effects on dinosaurs are still areas of ongoing research.<sup><a href="#cite_note-brusatte2014-231">[230]</a></sup>    Alongside dinosaurs, many other groups of animals became extinct: pterosaurs, marine reptiles such as mosasaurs and plesiosaurs, several groups of mammals, <a href="/wiki/Ammonoidea">ammonites</a> (<a href="/wiki/Nautilus">nautilus</a>-like
    <a href="/wiki/Mollusca">mollusks</a>), <a href="/wiki/Rudist">rudists</a> (<a href="/wiki/Reef">reef</a>-building <a href="/wiki/Bivalvia">bivalves</a>), and various groups of marine plankton.<sup><a href="#cite_note-macleod1997-232">[231]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-archibald1982-233">[232]</a></sup>    In all, approximately 47% of genera and 76% of species on Earth became extinct during the K-Pg extinction event.<sup><a href="#cite_note-jablonski1991-234">[233]</a></sup> The relatively large size of most dinosaurs and the low diversity of small-bodied
    dinosaur species at the end of the Cretaceous may have contributed to their extinction;<sup><a href="#cite_note-235">[234]</a></sup> the extinction of the bird lineages that did not survive may also have been caused by a dependence on forest habitats
    or a lack of adaptations to <a href="/wiki/Seed_predation">eating seeds</a> for survival.<sup><a href="#cite_note-field2018-236">[235]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-larson2016-237">[236]</a></sup></p>
<h3>Pre-extinction diversity</h3>
<p>Just before the K-Pg extinction event, the number of non-avian dinosaur species that existed globally has been estimated at between 628 and 1078.<sup><a href="#cite_note-leloeuff2012-238">[237]</a></sup> It remains uncertain whether the diversity of dinosaurs
    was in gradual decline before the K-Pg extinction event, or whether dinosaurs were actually thriving prior to the extinction. Rock formations from the <a href="/wiki/Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a> epoch, which directly preceded the extinction, have
    been found to have lower diversity than the preceding <a href="/wiki/Campanian">Campanian</a> epoch, which led to the prevailing view of a long-term decline in diversity.<sup><a href="#cite_note-macleod1997-232">[231]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-archibald1982-233">[232]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-carpenter1983-239">[238]</a></sup>    However, these comparisons did not account either for varying preservation potential between rock units or for different extents of exploration and excavation.<sup><a href="#cite_note-brusatte2014-231">[230]</a></sup> In 1984, <a href="/wiki/Dale_Russell">Dale Russell</a>    carried out an analysis to account for these biases, and found no evidence of a decline; <sup><a href="#cite_note-russell1984-240">[239]</a></sup> another analysis by David Fastovsky and colleagues in 2004 even showed that dinosaur diversity continually
    increased until the extinction,<sup><a href="#cite_note-fastovsky2004-241">[240]</a></sup> but this analysis has been rebutted.<sup><a href="#cite_note-sullivan2006-242">[241]</a></sup> Since then, different approaches based on statistics and mathematical
    models have variously supported either a sudden extinction<sup><a href="#cite_note-brusatte2014-231">[230]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-leloeuff2012-238">[237]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-chiarenza2019-243">[242]</a></sup> or a gradual

    in the Yucat&aacute;n Peninsula of southeastern <a href="/wiki/Mexico">Mexico</a>, and was publicized in a 1991 paper by <a href="/wiki/Alan_R._Hildebrand">Alan Hildebrand</a> and colleagues.
    <sup><a href="#cite_note-hildebrand1991-251">[250]</a></sup> Now, the bulk of the evidence suggests that a bolide 5 to 15 kilometers (3.1 to 9.3 miles) wide impacted the Yucat&aacute;n Peninsula 66 million years ago, forming this crater<sup><a href="#cite_note-pope1996-252">[251]</a></sup>    and creating a "kill mechanism" that triggered the extinction event.<sup><a href="#cite_note-schulte2010-253">[252]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-kring2007-254">[253]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-chiarenza2020-255">[254]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Deccan Traps</h3>

<p>At the time of the K-Pg extinction, the <a href="/wiki/Deccan_Traps">Deccan Traps</a> flood basalts of India were actively erupting. The eruptions can be separated into three phases around the K-Pg boundary, two prior to the boundary and one after. The
    second phase, which occurred very close to the boundary, would have extruded 70 to 80% of the volume of these eruptions in intermittent pulses that occurred around 100,000 years apart.<sup><a href="#cite_note-chenet2009-264">[263]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-schoene2019-265">[264]</a></sup>
    <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gases">Greenhouse gases</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sulphur_dioxide">sulphur dioxide</a> would have been released by this volcanic activity, <sup><a href="#cite_note-mclean1985-266">[265]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-self2006-267">[266]</a></sup>    resulting in <a href="/wiki/Climate_change">climate change</a> through temperature perturbations of roughly 3&nbsp;&deg;C (5.4&nbsp;&deg;F) but possibly as high as 7&nbsp;&deg;C (13&nbsp;&deg;F).<sup><a href="#cite_note-tobin2017-268">[267]</a></sup>    Like the Chicxulub impact, the eruptions may also have released sulphate aerosols, which would have caused acid rain and global cooling.<sup><a href="#cite_note-schmidt2016-269">[268]</a></sup> However, due to large error margins in the dating of
    the eruptions, the role of the Deccan Traps in the K-Pg extinction remains unclear.<sup><a href="#cite_note-renne2013-230">[229]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-brusatte2014-231">[230]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-hofman2000-270">[269]</a></sup></p>
<p>Before 2000, arguments that the Deccan Traps eruptions&mdash;as opposed to the Chicxulub impact&mdash;caused the extinction were usually linked to the view that the extinction was gradual. Prior to the discovery of the Chicxulub crater, the Deccan Traps
    were used to explain the global iridium layer;<sup><a href="#cite_note-mclean1985-266">[265]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-sahni1988-271">[270]</a></sup> even after the crater's discovery, the impact was still thought to only have had a regional,
    not global, effect on the extinction event.<sup><a href="#cite_note-glasby1996-272">[271]</a></sup> In response, Luis Alvarez rejected volcanic activity as an explanation for the iridium layer and the extinction as a whole.<sup><a href="#cite_note-alvarez1987-273">[272]</a></sup>    Since then, however, most researchers have adopted a more moderate position, which identifies the Chicxulub impact as the primary progenitor of the extinction while also recognizing that the Deccan Traps may also have played a role. Walter Alvarez
    himself has acknowledged that the Deccan Traps and other ecological factors may have contributed to the extinctions in addition to the Chicxulub impact.<sup><a href="#cite_note-alvarez1997-274">[273]</a></sup> Some estimates have placed the start
    of the second phase in the Deccan Traps eruptions within 50,000 years after the Chicxulub impact.<sup><a href="#cite_note-renne2015-275">[274]</a></sup> Combined with mathematical modelling of the
    <a href="/wiki/Seismic_wave">seismic waves</a> that would have been generated by the impact, this has led to the suggestion that the Chicxulub impact may have triggered these eruptions by increasing the permeability of the <a href="/wiki/Mantle_plume">mantle plume</a>    underlying the Deccan Traps.<sup><a href="#cite_note-richards2015-276">[275]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-khazins2019-277">[276]</a></sup></p>
<p>Whether the Deccan Traps were a major cause of the extinction, on par with the Chicxulub impact, remains uncertain. Proponents consider the climatic impact of the sulphur dioxide released to have been on par with the Chicxulub impact, and also note the
    role of flood basalt volcanism in other mass extinctions like the <a href="/wiki/Permian-Triassic_extinction_event">Permian-Triassic extinction event</a>. <sup><a href="#cite_note-archibald2010-278">[277]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-courtillot2010-279">[278]</a></sup>    They consider the Chicxulub impact to have worsened the ongoing climate change caused by the eruptions.<sup><a href="#cite_note-keller2014-280">[279]</a></sup> Meanwhile, detractors point out the sudden nature of the extinction and that other pulses
    in Deccan Traps activity of comparable magnitude did not appear to have caused extinctions. They also contend that the causes of different mass extinctions should be assessed separately.<sup><a href="#cite_note-schulte2010reply-281">[280]</a></sup>    In 2020, Alfio Chiarenza and colleagues suggested that the Deccan Traps may even have had the opposite effect: they suggested that the long-term warming caused by its carbon dioxide emissions may have dampened the impact winter from the Chicxulub
    impact.

<h3>Possible Paleocene survivors</h3>
<p>Non-avian dinosaur remains have occasionally been found above the K-Pg boundary. In 2000, <a href="/wiki/Spencer_G._Lucas">Spencer Lucas</a> and colleagues reported the discovery of a single hadrosaur right femur in the <a href="/wiki/San_Juan_Basin">San Juan Basin</a>    of <a href="/wiki/New_Mexico">New Mexico</a>, and described it as evidence of Paleocene dinosaurs. The rock unit in which the bone was discovered has been dated to the early <a href="/wiki/Paleocene">Paleocene</a> epoch, approximately 64.8 million
    years ago.<sup><a href="#cite_note-fassett2011-282">[281]</a></sup> If the bone was not <a href="/wiki/Deposition_(geology)">re-deposited</a> by weathering action, it would provide evidence that some dinosaur populations may have survived at least

<p>By human standards, dinosaurs were creatures of fantastic appearance and often enormous size. As such, they have captured the popular imagination and become an enduring part of human culture. The entry of the word "dinosaur" into the common
    <a href="/wiki/Vernacular">vernacular</a> reflects the animals' cultural importance: in English, "dinosaur" is commonly used to describe anything that is impractically large, obsolete, or bound for extinction.<sup><a href="#cite_note-m-w-289">[288]</a></sup></p>
<p>Public enthusiasm for dinosaurs first developed in <a href="/wiki/Victorian_era">Victorian</a> England, where in 1854, three decades after the first scientific descriptions of dinosaur remains, a menagerie of lifelike <a href="/wiki/Crystal_Palace_dinosaurs">dinosaur sculptures</a>    was unveiled in <a href="/wiki/London">London</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Crystal_Palace_Park">Crystal Palace Park</a>. The Crystal Palace dinosaurs proved so popular that a strong market in smaller replicas soon developed. In subsequent decades, dinosaur
    exhibits opened at parks and <a href="/wiki/Natural_history_museum">museums</a> around the world, ensuring that successive generations would be introduced to the animals in an immersive and exciting way.<sup><a href="#cite_note-torrens1993-290">[289]</a></sup>    The enduring popularity of dinosaurs, in its turn, has resulted in significant public funding for dinosaur science, and has frequently spurred new discoveries. In the United States, for example, the competition between museums for public attention
    led directly to the Bone Wars of the 1880s and 1890s, during which a pair of feuding paleontologists made enormous scientific contributions.<sup><a href="#cite_note-breithaupt1997-291">[290]</a></sup></p>
<p>The popular preoccupation with dinosaurs has ensured their appearance in <a href="/wiki/Literature">literature</a>, <a href="/wiki/Film">film</a>, and other <a href="/wiki/Media_(communication)">media</a>. Beginning in 1852 with a passing mention in
    <a href="/wiki/Charles_Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>' <em><a href="/wiki/Bleak_House">Bleak House</a></em>, <sup><a href="#cite_note-bleakhouse-292">[291]</a></sup> dinosaurs have been featured in large numbers of <a href="/wiki/Fiction">fictional</a>    works. <a href="/wiki/Jules_Verne">Jules Verne</a>'s 1864 novel <em><a href="/wiki/Journey_to_the_Center_of_the_Earth">Journey to the Center of the Earth</a></em>, <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle">Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</a>'s 1912 book
    <em><a href="/wiki/The_Lost_World_(Doyle_novel)">The Lost World</a></em>, the 1914 animated film <a href="/wiki/Gertie_the_Dinosaur">Gertie the Dinosaur</a> (featuring the first animated dinosaur), the iconic 1933 <a href="/wiki/Motion_picture">film</a><em><a href="/wiki/King_Kong_(1933_film)">King Kong</a></em>,
    the 1954 <em><a href="/wiki/Godzilla_(1954_film)">Godzilla</a></em> and its many sequels, the best-selling 1990 novel <em><a href="/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(novel)">Jurassic Park</a></em> by <a href="/wiki/Michael_Crichton">Michael Crichton</a> and its
    1993 <a href="/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)">film adaptation</a> are just a few notable examples of dinosaur appearances in fiction. Authors of general-interest <a href="/wiki/Non-fiction">non-fiction</a> works about dinosaurs, including some prominent
    paleontologists, have often sought to use the animals as a way to educate readers about science in general. Dinosaurs are ubiquitous in <a href="/wiki/Advertising">advertising</a>; numerous <a href="/wiki/Company_(law)">companies</a> have referenced
    dinosaurs in printed or televised advertisements, either in order to sell their own products or in order to characterize their rivals as slow-moving, dim-witted, or obsolete.<sup><a href="#cite_note-DFGlut1997-293">[292]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-294">[293]</a></sup></p>
